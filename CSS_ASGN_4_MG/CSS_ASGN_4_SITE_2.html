        <p> In the world of Hollow Knight, Dreams play a very important role throught the lore of the game.
            here is some context. The kingdom of hollownest used to be ruled by multiple factions, the Moths, Mosskin, Mantisis and Mushroom Clan,
            as well as the isolated Bees and Weaver Clan. Then the "Pale King" arrived and basically colonized everything, made a kingdom in the middle of everything
            and took areas from the others, while making the Moths forget their god "The Radience". eventually, everything reached a breaking point and the Radience, angry at being
            forgotten, unleashed a plague on the people of hollwnest, it was a infection of dreams, the domain of the Radience, that made peope basically zombies. the king didn't like
            that his people were being turned into zombies and so devised a plan to stop it, by sealing it into a vessel and having seals that would contain the vessel. and that
            is the main premis of the game, after years, the infection has broken out again and killed Hollownest, so the player needs to stop the infection.
