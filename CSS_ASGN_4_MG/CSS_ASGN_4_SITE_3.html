        <p> According to Hollowknight Lore, the Nightmare realm was split from the Dream Realm long ago. It is ruled by the 
            Nightmare Heart which in order to grow/sustain itself, goes to dead kingdoms as a traveling troupe to collect 
            the Nightmare flames that remain and partake in a ritual that results in the rebirth of the Troupe Master. In the game, 
            The Grimm Troupe is a side quest where you gather nightmare flames and return to fight the Troupe Master then the 
            "Nightmare King Grimm" in order to finish the ritual, abd once you do the Troupe disapears and you now posses the Grimm Child Charm. 
            or alternatively, you can banish the Troupe, banishing them and leaving you with the Carefree Melody Charm. It is largely beleved that
            tha Pale Kings idea of a vessel to contain the radience was inspired by the Toupe Master acting as a vessel for the Nightmare Heart.
